<!-- Fingerprint Logger Scripts -->
<!-- 
  This include adds fingerprint logging to track unique visitors.
  
  IMPORTANT: This file does NOT contain any secrets or tokens.
  All authentication happens server-side in the Netlify Function.
  
  Files included:
  1. fingerprint-logger.js - Generates SHA-256 fingerprint and logs to serverless endpoint
  2. whitelist-fingerprint.js - (Optional) Blocks access unless fingerprint is whitelisted
  
  SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
  
  For Netlify Deployment:
  =======================
  1. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
     - GITHUB_TOKEN (required): Personal access token with 'repo' scope
       Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
     - GITHUB_REPO (optional): Format 'owner/repo', defaults to StudyWithJesus/StudyWithJesus.github.io
  
  2. Deploy to Netlify - the function will be available at:
     /.netlify/functions/log-fingerprint
  
  3. Fingerprints will be logged as GitHub issues in your repository
  
  Using a Custom Webhook Instead:
  ================================
  To send fingerprints to a different endpoint (e.g., custom webhook):
  
  1. Edit assets/fingerprint-logger.js
  2. Change this line:
     const endpoint = '/.netlify/functions/log-fingerprint';
     To:
     const endpoint = 'https://your-webhook-url.com/log';
  
  3. Your webhook should accept POST requests with JSON payload:
     {
       "fp": "sha256-hash-string",
       "ua": "user-agent-string",
       "lang": "language-code",
       "tz": timezone-offset-minutes,
       "ts": "ISO-timestamp",
       "url": "page-url"
     }
  
  Blacklist Blocker (Enabled Site-Wide):
  ======================================
  The whitelist-fingerprint.js script blocks specific users.
  
  BEHAVIOR:
  - Everyone has access by default
  - Only blocks fingerprints marked as "BLOCKED" in the admin dashboard
  - Blocked list stored in browser localStorage (automatic sync)
  
  HOW TO USE:
  1. Visit /pages/admin/fingerprint-admin.html
  2. Click "Continue in Local Mode"
  3. Find the fingerprint you want to block
  4. Click the toggle switch to change status to "BLOCKED"
  5. That fingerprint will be blocked across all pages immediately
  
  NOTE: No manual configuration needed - blocking is managed through the admin dashboard
