- Block/unblock users by fingerprint
- Search by name, fingerprint, or IP
- Export blacklist configuration

- ✅ IPs are displayed in admin dashboard
- ✅ IPs are searchable
- ✅ IPs are logged in GitHub issues
- ⚠️ IPs are NOT used for blocking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't access admin pages?
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify OAuth callback URL matches exactly
3. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors

### "Access Denied" after login?
1. Verify `ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME` matches your GitHub username
2. Username comparison is case-insensitive
3. Redeploy after changing environment variables

### IP addresses show as "N/A"?
- This is normal for local storage entries
- Real IPs come from Netlify function
- Deploy to Netlify to see real IPs
