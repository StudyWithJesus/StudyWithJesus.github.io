## Legacy Netlify Site Information

- **Site Name**: silly-speculoos-4afae0
- **Site URL**: https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app
- **Admin URL**: https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app/pages/admin/index.html
- **Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0

## Recommended Migration Path

Instead of using Netlify OAuth, migrate to Firebase Authentication:

1. Follow [FIREBASE_GITHUB_AUTH_SETUP.md](../FIREBASE_GITHUB_AUTH_SETUP.md)
2. Firebase works on both Netlify and GitHub Pages
3. Better security and user experience
4. No serverless functions required

## Legacy Setup (Not Recommended)

If you must continue using Netlify OAuth:
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/configuration/env
   - Or: Netlify Dashboard → Site configuration → Environment variables

2. **Add Required Variables**

   Click "Add a variable" for each:

   ### GITHUB_CLIENT_ID (Required)
   ```
   Key: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   Value: [Your OAuth App Client ID from Step 1]
   Scopes: Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys
   ```

   ### GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (Required)
   ```
   Key: GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
   Value: [Your OAuth App Client Secret from Step 1]
   Options: ✓ Keep this value secret
   Scopes: Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys
   ```

   ### ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME (Required)
   ```
   Key: ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME
   Value: [Your GitHub username, e.g., "StudyWithJesus"]
   Scopes: Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys
   ```
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only this GitHub username will have admin access!

3. **Add Optional Variables** (for fingerprint logging)

   ### GITHUB_TOKEN (Optional)
   ```
   Key: GITHUB_TOKEN
   Value: [Personal access token with 'repo' scope]
   Options: ✓ Keep this value secret
   Scopes: Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys
   ```
   - Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Required scope: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - Used to create GitHub issues when fingerprints are logged

   ### GITHUB_REPO (Optional)
   ```
   Key: GITHUB_REPO
   Value: StudyWithJesus/StudyWithJesus.github.io
   Scopes: Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys
   ```
   - Defaults to `StudyWithJesus/StudyWithJesus.github.io` if not set
   - Repository where fingerprint logs are created as issues

---

## Step 3: Configure Netlify OAuth (Optional)

Netlify also has built-in OAuth providers that can be used for additional features.

1. **Go to OAuth Settings**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/configuration/access#oauth
   - Or: Netlify Dashboard → Site configuration → Access & security → OAuth

2. **Install GitHub Provider** (if using Netlify OAuth)
   - Click "Install provider" under GitHub
   - This is **optional** and separate from the GitHub OAuth App
   - Only needed if you want to use Netlify's OAuth features
   - **Not required for admin authentication** (we use custom OAuth function)

---

## Step 4: Deploy the Site

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure admin authentication"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Deploy**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/deploys
   - Netlify will automatically deploy when you push
   - Or click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

3. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Watch the deploy logs
   - Should complete in 1-2 minutes
   - Green checkmark = success

4. **Check Functions**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/functions
   - Verify `github-oauth` function is listed
   - Verify `log-fingerprint` function is listed

---

## Step 5: Test Admin Access

1. **Visit Admin Hub**
   - Go to: https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app/pages/admin/index.html

2. **Sign In with GitHub**
   - Click "Sign in with GitHub" button
   - Authorize the OAuth app
   - You should be redirected back to admin hub

3. **Verify Access**
   - ✅ If logged in as your GitHub account → Admin dashboard appears
   - ❌ If logged in as different account → "Access Denied" message

4. **Test Admin Pages**
   - Fingerprint Admin: https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app/pages/admin/fingerprint-admin.html
   - Leaderboard Admin: https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app/pages/admin/leaderboard.html

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration Error" when accessing admin

**Problem**: Environment variables not set

**Solution**:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/configuration/env
2. Verify all three required variables are set:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME`
3. Click "Trigger deploy" to redeploy

### "Access Denied" after GitHub login

**Problem**: Wrong GitHub username in `ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME`

**Solution**:
1. Check your exact GitHub username at: https://github.com/[your-username]
2. Update `ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAME` to match exactly (case-insensitive)
3. Redeploy the site

### OAuth redirect error

**Problem**: Callback URL mismatch

**Solution**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Edit your OAuth app
3. Verify "Authorization callback URL" is exactly:
   ```
   https://silly-speculoos-4afae0.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/github-oauth
   ```
4. Save changes

### Functions not working

**Problem**: Netlify functions not deploying

**Solution**:
1. Check deploy logs: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/deploys
2. Look for function build errors
3. Verify `netlify.toml` exists in repository root
4. Check function logs: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-speculoos-4afae0/functions

### Session expires immediately

**Problem**: Cookie issues

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're using HTTPS (Netlify provides this)
2. Clear browser cookies and cache
3. Try incognito/private browsing
4. Check browser console for errors

---

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Don't hardcode `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in code
   - Use environment variables only
   - Keep secrets in Netlify dashboard

2. **Protect admin URLs**
   - Don't link to admin pages from public pages
   - Bookmark admin URLs privately
   - Only share with authorized users

3. **Monitor access**
   - Check function logs for unauthorized attempts
   - Review GitHub OAuth app access regularly
   - Revoke compromised tokens immediately

4. **IP tracking**
   - IPs are logged for information only
   - IPs are NOT used for blocking
   - Only fingerprints (device IDs) control access
