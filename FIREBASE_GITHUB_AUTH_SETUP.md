# Firebase Authentication with GitHub Setup Guide

> **🚀 Quick Setup:** For exact copy-paste values to use in your GitHub OAuth App, see [GITHUB_OAUTH_QUICK_ANSWER.md](../GITHUB_OAUTH_QUICK_ANSWER.md)

This guide explains how to set up GitHub authentication for the admin pages using Firebase Authentication, which works on GitHub Pages and any static hosting platform.

## Overview

The admin pages use **Firebase Authentication with GitHub provider** for secure authentication. This works on GitHub Pages (https://studywithjesus.github.io) and any static hosting platform without requiring serverless functions.

## What Changed

### Authentication Flow
- **Before**: Required custom backend authentication solutions
- **After**: Uses Firebase Authentication with GitHub provider, which works on any static hosting including GitHub Pages

### Admin Access
- **Before**: Required custom claims configured via Cloud Functions
- **After**: Any authenticated GitHub user has admin access (you can add a whitelist if needed)

### Data Loading
- **Before**: Showed sample data when custom claims weren't configured
- **After**: Loads real Firebase data once authenticated

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (if not already done)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Your project should already exist: `studywithjesus`
3. If not, create a new project

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Authentication in Firebase

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Click on **GitHub** in the providers list
3. Click **Enable**
4. You'll need to provide:
   - **GitHub Client ID**
   - **GitHub Client Secret**

### Step 3: Create GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Application name**: `StudyWithJesus Firebase Auth`
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://studywithjesus.github.io`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: Get this from Firebase (see Step 4)
4. Click **Register application**
5. Copy the **Client ID**
6. Generate a **Client Secret** and copy it

### Step 4: Get Firebase Callback URL

1. Back in Firebase Console (Authentication → Sign-in method → GitHub)
2. Copy the **Authorization callback URL** shown in the GitHub provider setup
3. It should look like: `https://studywithjesus.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`

### Step 5: Update GitHub OAuth App

1. Return to your GitHub OAuth App settings
2. Paste the Firebase callback URL in the **Authorization callback URL** field
3. Save the application

### Step 6: Complete Firebase GitHub Setup

1. Back in Firebase Console
2. Paste your **GitHub Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the Firebase GitHub provider settings
3. Click **Save**

### Step 7: Add Authorized Domains (if needed)

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
2. Make sure these domains are authorized:
   - `studywithjesus.github.io` (for GitHub Pages)
   - Any other custom domain you use
   - `localhost` (for local testing)

## Testing the Setup

### Test Admin Login

1. Go to: https://studywithjesus.github.io/pages/admin/index.html
2. Click **"Sign in with GitHub"**
3. A popup should appear asking you to authorize the app
4. Click **"Authorize"**
5. You should be redirected back to the admin page, now logged in
6. You should see your GitHub avatar and username

### Test Admin Leaderboard

1. Go to: https://studywithjesus.github.io/pages/admin/leaderboard.html
2. If you're logged in, you should see:
   - Your user info at the top
   - **Data Source**: Should show "Live" instead of "Sample"
   - Real data from Firestore (if any exists)

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication module is not loaded"
- Check that `firebase.config.js` and `github-auth.js` are loaded before the page scripts
- Check browser console for any loading errors

### "Sign in with GitHub" button doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure popup blockers aren't preventing the sign-in popup
- Verify Firebase configuration is correct in `config/firebase.config.js`

### "Firebase not configured"
- Ensure `window.FIREBASE_CONFIG` is set in `config/firebase.config.js`
- Check that Firebase is initialized properly

### Still showing sample data
- Make sure you're signed in (check for user info at top of page)
- Verify Firestore has data in the `attempts` collection
- Check browser console for any Firebase errors
- Ensure Firestore security rules allow authenticated reads

### Popup closes immediately
- This might be a popup blocker
- Try allowing popups for your site
- You can also use redirect-based auth instead (would require code changes)

## Security Considerations

### Admin Access Control

By default, any authenticated GitHub user is treated as an admin. To restrict access to specific users:

1. Edit `assets/js/leaderboard-firebase.js`
2. In the `isAdmin()` function, uncomment and modify the whitelist:

```javascript
// Fallback: Any authenticated GitHub user has admin access
// In production, you can add a whitelist here:
const adminUsers = ['your-github-username', 'another-admin'];
const username = auth.currentUser.reloadUserInfo?.screenName || auth.currentUser.displayName;
return adminUsers.includes(username);
```

### Firestore Security Rules

Make sure your Firestore security rules allow authenticated users to read admin data:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read attempts for admin view
    match /attempts/{attempt} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Add other collection rules as needed
  }
}
```

## Authentication Support

The authentication system uses Firebase Authentication exclusively, which works on:
- ✅ GitHub Pages
- ✅ Any static hosting platform (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)
- ✅ Custom domains with HTTPS

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Works on GitHub Pages**: No serverless functions required
2. **Better User Experience**: Popup-based auth is faster than redirects
3. **Persistent Sessions**: Firebase handles session management automatically
4. **Secure**: All authentication handled by Firebase/GitHub
5. **Free**: Firebase Authentication is free for most use cases

## Next Steps

After setting up authentication:

1. **Add Data to Firestore**: Start submitting exam attempts to populate the leaderboard
2. **Set Up Security Rules**: Ensure proper Firestore rules are in place
3. **Optional - Add Custom Claims**: For more granular admin control via Cloud Functions
4. **Optional - Add User Whitelist**: Restrict admin access to specific GitHub users

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all setup steps were completed
3. Check Firebase Console for authentication logs
4. Review Firestore security rules
5. Ensure you're using a modern browser with popups enabled
